# The Gray Garden for Discord

I do not own this, original owner goes to DSP/Funamusea.
This is just a port to Discord.

## HOW DO YOU COMPILE?

Get RoboJS, and then... (WIP)

## HOW DO YOU PLAY?

Open discord and go to [This Link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1408960156410314825&integration_type=1&scope=applications.commands) to add the activity to your server or your DMS.

Then, go to a random dm or server you added the activity to, (VCS IN BIG SERVERS DON'T WORK YET!! BECAUSE THE ACTIVITY ISN'T VERIFIED) and click on the apps button.

Next, click on The Gray Garden, and then click on "Open in DMS". and enjoy!
